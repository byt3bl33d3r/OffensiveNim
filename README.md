## Why Nim?

- Compiles *directly* to C, C++, Objective-C and Javascript.
- Since it doesn't rely on a VM/runtime does not produce what I like to call "T H I C C malwarez" as supposed to other languages (e.g. Golang)
- Python inspired syntax, allows rapid native payload creation & prototyping.
- Has **extremely** mature [FFI](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#foreign-function-interface) (Foreign Function Interface) capabilities.
- Avoids making you actually write in C/C++ and subsequently avoids introducing a lot of security issues into your software.
- Super easy cross compilation to Windows from *nix/MacOS, only requires you to install the `mingw` toolchain and passing a single flag to the nim compiler.
- The Nim compiler and the generated executables support all major platforms like Windows, Linux, BSD and macOS. Can even compile to Nintendo switch , IOS & Android. See the cross-compilation section in the [Nim compiler usage guide](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/nimc.html#crossminuscompilation)
- You could *technically* write your implant and c2 backend both in Nim as you can compile your code directly to Javascript. Even has some [initial support for WebAssembly's](https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/4779)

## Compiling the examples in this repo

This repository does not provide binaries, you're gonna have to compile them yourself. This repo was setup to cross-compile the example Nim source files to Windows from Linux or MacOS.

### Easy Way (Recommended)

Use [VSCode Devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) to automatically setup a development environment for you (See the [Setting Up a Dev Environment](#setting-up-a-dev-environment) section). Once that's done simply run `make`.

### Hard way (For the bold)

[Install Nim](https://nim-lang.org/install_unix.html) using your systems package manager (for Windows [use the installer on the official website](https://nim-lang.org/install_windows.html))

- `brew install nim`
- `apt install nim`
- `choco install nim`

(Nim also provides a [docker image on Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nimlang/nim/))

You should now have the `nim` & `nimble` commands available, the former is the Nim compiler and the latter is Nim's package manager.

Install the `Mingw` toolchain needed for cross-compilation to Windows (Not needed if you're compiling on Windows):
- *nix: `apt-get install mingw-w64`
- MacOS: `brew install mingw-w64`

Finally, install the magnificent [Winim](https://github.com/khchen/winim) library, along with [zippy](https://github.com/guzba/zippy/) and [nimcrypto](https://github.com/cheatfate/nimcrypto)

- `nimble install winim zippy nimcrypto`

Then cd into the root of this repository and run `make`.

You should find the binaries and dlls in the `bin/` directory

## Cross Compiling

See the cross-compilation section in the [Nim compiler usage guide](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/nimc.html#crossminuscompilation), for a lot more details.

Cross compiling to Windows from MacOs/*nix requires the `mingw` toolchain, usually a matter of just `brew install mingw-w64` or `apt install mingw-w64`.

You then just have to pass the  `-d=mingw` flag to the nim compiler.

E.g. `nim c -d=mingw --app=console --cpu=amd64 source.nim`

## Interfacing with C/C++

See the insane [FFI section](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#foreign-function-interface) in the Nim manual.

If you're familiar with csharps P/Invoke it's essentially the same concept albeit a looks a tad bit uglier:

Calling `MessageBox` example

```nim
type
    HANDLE* = int
    HWND* = HANDLE
    UINT* = int32
    LPCSTR* = cstring

proc MessageBox*(hWnd: HWND, lpText: LPCSTR, lpCaption: LPCSTR, uType: UINT): int32 
  {.discardable, stdcall, dynlib: "user32", importc: "MessageBoxA".}

MessageBox(0, "Hello, world !", "Nim is Powerful", 0)
```

For any complex Windows API calls use the [Winim library](https://github.com/khchen/winim), saves an insane amount of time and doesn't add too much to the executable size (see below) depending on how you import it.

Even has COM support!!!

## Creating Windows DLLs with an exported `DllMain`

Big thanks to the person who posted [this](https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/1973) on the Nim forum.

The Nim compiler tries to create a `DllMain` function for you automatically at compile time whenever you tell it to create a windows DLL, however, it doesn't actually export it for some reason. In order to have an exported `DllMain` you need to pass `--nomain` and define a `DllMain` function yourself with the appropriate pragmas (`stdcall, exportc, dynlib`).

You need to also call `NimMain` from your `DllMain` to initialize Nim's garbage collector. (Very important, otherwise your computer will literally explode).

Example:

```nim
import winim/lean

proc NimMain() {.cdecl, importc.}

proc DllMain(hinstDLL: HINSTANCE, fdwReason: DWORD, lpvReserved: LPVOID) : BOOL {.stdcall, exportc, dynlib.} =
  NimMain()
  
  if fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
    MessageBox(0, "Hello, world !", "Nim is Powerful", 0)

  return true
```

To compile:

```
nim c -d=mingw --app=lib --nomain --cpu=amd64 mynim.dll
```

### Creating XLLs
You can make an XLL (an Excel DLL, imagine that) with an auto open function that can be used for payload delivery. The following code creates a simple for an XLL that has an auto open function and all other boilerplate code needed to compile as a link library. The POC compiles as a DLL, you can then change the extension to .xll and it will open in Excel and run the payload when double clicked:

```nim
#[
    Compile:
        nim c -d=mingw --app=lib --nomain --cpu=amd64 nim_xll.nim
        
    Will compile as a DLL, you can then just change the extension to .xll
]#

import winim/lean

proc xlAutoOpen() {.stdcall, exportc, dynlib.} =
    MessageBox(0, "Hello, world !", "Nim is Powerful", 0)

proc NimMain() {.cdecl, importc.}

proc DllMain(hinstDLL: HINSTANCE, fdwReason: DWORD, lpvReserved: LPVOID) : BOOL {.stdcall, exportc, dynlib.} =
  NimMain()

  return true
```

There are many other sneaky things that can be done with XLLs. See [more examples of XLL tradecraft here](https://github.com/Octoberfest7/XLL_Phishing).

## Optimizing executables for size

Taken from the [Nim's FAQ page](https://nim-lang.org/faq.html)

For the biggest size decrease use the following flags `-d:danger -d:strip --opt:size`

Additionally, I've found you can squeeze a few more bytes out by passing `--passc=-flto --passl=-flto` to the compiler. Also take a look at the `Makefile` in this repo.

These flags decrease sizes **dramatically**: the shellcode injection example goes from 484.3 KB to 46.5 KB when cross-compiled from MacOSX!

## Reflectively Loading Nim Executables

Huge thanks to [@Shitsecure](https://twitter.com/ShitSecure) for figuring this out!

By default, Nim doesn't generate PE's with a relocation table which is needed by most tools that reflectively load EXE's.

To generate a Nim executable *with* a relocation section you need to pass a few additional flags to the linker. 

Specifically: ```--passL:-Wl,--dynamicbase```

Full example command:
```
nim c --passL:-Wl,--dynamicbase my_awesome_malwarez.nim
```

## Executable size difference when using the Winim library vs without

Incredibly enough the size difference is pretty negligible. Especially when you apply the size optimizations outlined above.

The two examples `pop_bin.nim` and `pop_winim_bin.nim` were created for this purpose.

The former defines the `MessageBox` WinAPI call manually and the latter uses the Winim library (specifically `winim/lean` which is only the core SDK, see [here](https://github.com/khchen/winim#usage)), results:

```
byt3bl33d3r@ecl1ps3 OffensiveNim % ls -lah bin
-rwxr-xr-x  1 byt3bl33d3r  25K Nov 20 18:32 pop_bin_32.exe
-rwxr-xr-x  1 byt3bl33d3r  32K Nov 20 18:32 pop_bin_64.exe
-rwxr-xr-x  1 byt3bl33d3r  26K Nov 20 18:33 pop_winim_bin_32.exe
-rwxr-xr-x  1 byt3bl33d3r  34K Nov 20 18:32 pop_winim_bin_64.exe
```

If you import the entire Winim library with `import winim/com` it adds only around ~20ish KB which considering the amount of functionality it abstracts is 100% worth that extra size:
```
byt3bl33d3r@ecl1ps3 OffensiveNim % ls -lah bin
-rwxr-xr-x  1 byt3bl33d3r  42K Nov 20 19:20 pop_winim_bin_32.exe
-rwxr-xr-x  1 byt3bl33d3r  53K Nov 20 19:20 pop_winim_bin_64.exe
```

## Opsec Considerations

Because of how Nim resolves DLLs dynamically using `LoadLibrary` using it's FFI none of your external imported functions will actually show up in the executables static imports (see [this blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20210117002945/https://secbytes.net/implant-roulette-part-1:-nimplant/) for more on this):

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5151193/99911179-d0dd6000-2caf-11eb-933a-6a7ada510747.png)

If you compile Nim source to a DLL, seems like you'll always have an exported `NimMain`, no matter if you specify your own `DllMain` or not (??). This could potentially be used as a signature, don't know how many shops are actually using Nim in their development stack. Definitely stands out.

## Writing Nim without the Nim Runtime

Since Nim is heavily flagged by Anti-Virus solutions, one way around this is writing Nim programs without the Nim runtime. [Writing Nim-less Nim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXX3HmCG3pw) is a talk given on the steps outlining how to write Nim code without the Nim and C runtime, source code from this talk is available [here](https://github.com/m4ul3r/writing_nimless). The talk follows and expands on [zimawhit3's](https://github.com/zimawhit3) work with [Bitmancer](https://github.com/zimawhit3/Bitmancer/tree/main).

The premise is to rely on `winim`'s type definitions and leverage code writing that would not result in Nim's runtime being used. 

## Converting C code to Nim

https://github.com/nim-lang/c2nim

Used it to translate a bunch of small C snippets, haven't tried anything major.

## Language Bridges

  - Python integration https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy
    * This is actually super interesting, [especially this part](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy/blob/master/nimpy/py_lib.nim#L330). With some modification could this load the PythonxXX.dll from memory?

  - Jave VM integration: https://github.com/yglukhov/jnim

## Debugging

Use the `repr()` function in combination with `echo`, supports almost all (??) data types, even structs!

See [this blog post for more](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2017/10/02/documenting-profiling-and-debugging-nim-code.html)

## Setting up a dev environment

This repository supports [VSCode Devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/create-dev-container) which allows you to develop in a Docker container. This automates setting up a development environment for you.

1. Install VSCode and Docker desktop
2. Clone this repo and open it in VSCode
3. Install the `Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers` extension
4. Open the command pallete and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` command

VScode will now build the Docker image (will take a bit) and put you right into your pre-built Nim dev environment!

## Pitfalls I found myself falling into

- When calling winapi's with Winim and trying to pass a null value, make sure you pass the `NULL` value (defined within the Winim library) as supposed Nim's builtin `nil` value. (Ugh)

- To get the OS handle to the created file after calling `open()` on Windows, you need to call `f.getOsFileHandle()` **not** `f.getFileHandle()` cause reasons.

- The Nim compiler does accept arguments in the form `-a=value` or `--arg=value` even tho if you look at the usage it only has arguments passed as `-a:value` or `--arg:value`. (Important for Makefiles)

- When defining a byte array, you also need to indicate at least in the first value that it's a byte array, bit weird but ok (https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/4322)

Byte array in C#:
```csharp
byte[] buf = new byte[5] {0xfc,0x48,0x81,0xe4,0xf0,0xff}
```

Byte array in Nim:
```nim
var buf: array[5, byte] = [byte 0xfc,0x48,0x81,0xe4,0xf0,0xff]
```
